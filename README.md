# 🌲 Forest Cover Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **forest cover types** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various **geographical and environmental features**, the model can accurately classify the type of forest cover for a given area.  
This can support better **forest management**, **conservation efforts**, and **resource planning**.
