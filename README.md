orest Cover Prediction
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting forest cover types using machine learning techniques. Using various geographic and environmental features, the model predicts the type of forest cover for a given area. The goal is to assist in forest management, conservation, and resource planning.

Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Covertype Dataset

Description: The dataset contains cartographic variables (like elevation, slope, soil type, etc.) and the corresponding forest cover type.

Features: 54 attributes including quantitative and binary variables.

Target: Forest cover type (7 classes).
